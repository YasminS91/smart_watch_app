     <dt>Samuel Messinger 	    (7006182)</dt>
        <dd>
        Sam has proficient knowledge of HTML and CSS, as a result of a few years of practice and study at university.
        He is confident in his ability to code in either Java or C, and mostly confident with C#. He does not have knowledge of SVG or the <canvas> element, and only limited knowledge with working with JavaScript. 
        Sam is more of a follower rather than a leader, and can be dedicated to a job when set on it. He is good at proof-reading and editing of work such as reports, but not as good as writing them in the first place.
        </dd>
     <dt>Finnegan Miles-Hussey (5453391)</dt>
        <dd> 
        Finnegan is confident working with Java &amp; C. He has working knowledge of HTML5 &amp; CSS. 
        He has little to no knowledge of JavaScript, SVG &amp; the &lt;canvas&gt; element. Can write the report with no issues.
        </dd>
     <dt>Robert Young          (3176240)</dt>
        <dd>
        Robert knows enough HTML/CSS to make a basic website and is familiar with Javascript. 
        He has working knowledge in C and Java along with some basic ability in C++ and Perl. 
        He doesn't know any JQuery, SVG or &lt;canvas&gt; at the moment, but he's currently learning them.
        </dd>
        <dt>Yasmin Saleem</dt>
        <dd> Yasmin has enough knowledge of html5 , css, php, jquery and javascript to build a web application.<br>
        She also has a good knowledge of Java, fine knowledge of C and a relatively ok knowledge of C++ but not enough to write big complicated programs.
<br>She started coding just a year and a half ago so she does not have any working experience in any of the mentioned languages apart from studying.
<br>Yasmin is good at organising group meetings and managing the flow of work.</dd>

    <h2>Description of App</h2>
        <p>
            With such a small screen, reading on a smartwatch the conventional way could be difficult. 
            By printing one word to the screen at a time in quick succession, our application would implement Rapid Serial Visual
            Representation, an alternative method of reading that would be ideal for the small screen of a smartwatch.
            RSVR implementations such as Spritz and Spreeder have been created before, but, to our group’s knowledge,
            one hasn’t been created for the smartwatch. Our application would access text files from the smartwatch’s file system
            and present them to the user with easily customisable speeds and fonts.
            What makes our application good for our group is that it is easily scalable, significantly 
            decreasing our risk of failure. It could start out by interpreting .txt files before moving on to pdf, 
            docx, and epub files along with other ebook formats. Ideally, we hope to eventually give our 
            app HTML-reading capabilities, opening up the possibility of creating a primitive browser for the smartwatch.

    <h2>Version Control System</h2>
    <p>Why GitHub?</p>
    <p>
        GitHub offers all of the distributed revision control (allows many software developers to work on a project without 
        requiring them to share a common network) and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own 
        features.<br> Source control or revision control is the management of changes to documents, web sites, computer programs and
        information. It provides the ability of reverting a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing 
        editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming.
       <br> GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. <br>It also provides access control 
        (selective authorization to access resources) and several collaboration features such as bug tracking 
        (keeps track of reported software bugs/updated about new discovered bugs), feature requests, task management, wikis for every 
        project. Add to that documentation, issue tracking, search engine, nested tasks-list (time management) within files, 
        hosting small websites from public repositories on GitHub, specified graphs, directory of integration, commits 
        history email notifications, etc. <br>By using GitHub, time and space required to install software on probably thousands 
        of client computers.<br> GitHub is a client-server software application that the client runs in a web browser.<br>
        GitHub allows registered and non-registered users to browse public repositories on the site. Registered users can 
        discuss, manages, create repositories, submit their contribution to others’ repositories and review changes to code.
      <br>  GitHub provides functions that perform as a social network, such as followers, feed, wiki, a a graph that keeps track of developers’ work and shows what version of work is the newest. 
       <br> GitHub offers both plans for private repositories and free accounts, which are usually used to host open-source software projects.

    <h2>Programming Language</h2>
    <h2>The Editor</h2>
        <p>
+            The team has chosen to use NetBeans, which is an open source code editor. We decided to use NetBeans as, first of all, it is able to run on both windows and OSX, which were necessary for our group. NetBeans also provides functionality such as syntax highlighting, code analysis and code completion, which is very easy to use, and features drag-and-drop functionality for quickly creating GUI's, which was an extra bonus.
+            NetBeans also features database support, including built-in functionality for SQL and Oracle. This editor also has a built in debugger, which allows you to inspect your code step-by-step to see where any issues are occurring. NetBeans also has additional support for JavaScript, the language we will be coding in, with it's integrated JavaScript editor.
+            Finally, NetBeans also has direct support for working with GitHub, making it much easier for the team to push/pull the project when needed. When any important change is made, we will be able to ‘push’ the project to the repository and instantly have a working backup.
